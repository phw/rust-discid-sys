## About
discid-sys provides automatically generated, unsafe Rust bindings for
MusicBrainz [libdiscid](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid).

You usually don't want to use these bindings directly but instead use the
safe [discid](https://crates.io/crates/discid) wrapper library.

## Requirements
* libdiscid >= 0.6.0
